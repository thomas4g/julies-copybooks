<h4>Smart Coding</h4>
<h5>Why?</h5>
I recently had a discussion about semantics and the role 
of markup and scripting and where their paths meet and where they don't.&nbsp; 
Apparently it's rather a touchy matter. Obviously some web developers couldn't 
care less about what their <a href="http://enterprise-html.com/">markup</a>,
<a href="http://enterprise-css.com/">styling</a>, and
<a href="http://enterprise-js.com/">scripts</a> look like as long as the 
finished product looks good. (<em>See </em>Sites, Commercial) <br>But smart 
coding is important for a few reasons: <br>

<ul>
	<li>A futuristic coding mindset <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - code in such a way 
	that your site will work in the next several iterations of any given 
	browser. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - code in such a way that your site can 
	easily be updated by you or (presumably) a different developer 5 years 
	forward</li>
	<li>Site speed: the cleaner, more semantic, and simpler your code is, the 
	faster it loads and works. Elementary.</li>
</ul>
<h5>What?</h5>
<p>First off, what is <em>semantics?&nbsp; </em>Glad you asked. </p>
	<span>se·man·tics</span><span>&nbsp;[&nbsp;sə 
	mántiks&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
			<ol>
				<li><b>study of meaning in language:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>the 
				study of how meaning in language is created by the use and 
				interrelationships of words, phrases, and sentences</li>
				<li><b>study of symbols:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>the 
				study of the relationship between symbols and what they 
				represent</li>
				<li><b>study of logic:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>the 
				study of ways of interpreting and analyzing theories of logic</li>
			</ol>
<span>se·man·tic</span><span>&nbsp;[&nbsp;sə 
	mántik&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
			<ol>
				<li><b>relating to word meanings:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>relating 
				to meaning or the differences between meanings of words or 
				symbols</li>
				<li><b>of semantics:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>relating

				<li><b>relating to truth:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>relating 
				to the conditions in which a system or theory can be said to be 
				true</li>
			</ol>

<p>When we're talking about <em>semantic markup</em>, we mean that the tags that 
form our HTML should be wrapping content that you would expect them to wrap, 
even if it could <em>technically</em> be otherwise. Tags <em>tell</em> you what 
they're supposed to contain; don't put anything else in them. Just because you 
can doesn't mean you should. A <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag should contain the
<em>body</em> of the page. Scripts and style sheets <em>don't go there</em>. A 
&lt;p&gt; is a paragraph. Don't use it to layout the page; it's for a paragraph 
of text. Again, elementary.</p>
<h5>How?</h5>
<p>Okay. Definition time.

</p>
<ul>
	<li>HTML === <em>Hypertext <strong>Markup</strong> Language</em></li>
	<li>Javascript === scripting language independent from but primarily used 
	for interaction with the DOM. (Oh, and <em>Javascript !== Java</em>)</li>
	<li>CSS === <em>Cascading <strong>Style</strong> sheets</em></li>
	<li>Oh, and DOM === <em>Document Object Model</em></li>
</ul>
<p>(notice how there's no type coercion for those equalities...)</p>
<p>Okay, PDS (<em>Pretty Dang Simple)</em>, eh? Right? But lots of people don't 
get it. One thing I've certainly learned, (esp. thanks to all pals at SO) is to 
keep a separation of concerns. Here's three <em>freakishly obvious, 
why-the-crap-don't-more-people-get-this??!?, fundamental to web design</em> 
principles:</p>
<ol>
	<li>HTML is for organizing your content as semantically as possible. Period.
	</li>
	<li>CSS is for effectively displaying your content in a style fashion. 
	Period.</li>
	<li>Javascript is for scripting content to <em>improve</em> user 
	interaction. Comma. Just kidding. Period.</li>
</ol>
<p>"<em>But wait!</em>" you say, in all your annoying impertinence, "<em>doesn't 
HTML help with styling too? What about the infamous clearfix? Classnames, 
ids? That's all styling, right?"</em> </p>
<p>Sort of.  I for one say clearfixing is a stupid perk that should go away 
as the languages improve. For one, just use the clearfix on an element that's 
already down there. Explicitly setting the overflow is supposed to work as well.
Ids and class names are used for the styling to know what it's working with, but 
they also help with semantics by providing a description for the more obscure 
elements. </p>
<p>Basically the point I'm trying to make here is you shouldn't have to write 
your HTML for your CSS. You write your HTML for your content. You write your CSS 
for your HTML.  Writing semantic HTML helps you write HTML that snaps to 
the content, and vice-versa. Example: semantic HTML is the center column of a 
three column layout <em>first</em> in your markup because it is more important, 
even though there is no technical difference. If you're doing it right, the CSS 
shouldn't need that column "in-between" the other two anyways. As a 
corollary (read: <em>insert cool word for related-point</em>), you would never 
use a three-column just because it looks good; you use it to support the overall 
message and content of the site. Write HTML for your content. </p>
<p>A three-column design with a header and footer should be simple:<br>
<code class="block">
&lt;header&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;img id="logo"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;nav&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;ol&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;li&gt;Products&lt;/li&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/ol&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;/nav&gt;<br>&lt;/header&gt;
<br>&lt;section id="main"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&lt;div id="leftCol"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;div id="rightCol"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
&lt;/section&gt;<br>&lt;footer&gt;Copyright&lt;/footer&gt;</code></p>
<p>I'm not saying the above is perfect by any standard. But it's closer to 
semantic then a heck of a lot of markup up there, mostly because it couldn't 
care less what the CSS and Javascript does. That's the point. You should be able 
to keep generally the same layout with markup but radically change the design 
with CSS. In the above example, the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag contains items that form a 
header. The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag contains the primary piece ("1") of the header ("h"). The 
image's id is marked in such a way as to communicate the specific purpose of 
this generic tag.&nbsp; The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag is used to contain navigation. The <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> 
tag contains an ordered list of <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> list items. Depending on the navigation, 
the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag could be used - I think it most cases, navigation <em>is</em> 
ordered - you want the viewer to read your home page first, then view your 
products, then contact you.&nbsp; The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag contains a <em>section</em> 
that is "main" - as delimited by the id. And etc., etc. You guys get it.
</p>
<p>This brings up an avenue into the philosophy of web design. Like other kinds 
of design - CD Album Art, Software products, etc. - the design is just a means 
to an end; a pretty way of displaying content. This is one reason I don't really 
like templates - it feels forced, often simply because it doesn't know what you 
want to use it for. You have to know what your content is, then design 
for it. (Blah blah blah...)</p>
<p>Anywho. What <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/17/javascript">I and the guys</a> were actually talking about was scripting and how 
it relates to markup. I had placed an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> outside of a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag 
because a script was interacting with it and I didn't want it to get posted back 
with the rest of the form's content. Remember how I said markup is for arranging 
your content semantically, period? I lied. It also, occasionally, has to serve as 
a means of taking input - it's the portal to the actual interaction with the 
user that comes via scripting or server-side code. And right around here 
is where "semantics" starts jumping around. My <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> was indeed something that 
needed to get posted back to the server - the reason I didn't put it in was 
because my script was putting it in (handling the formatting). See, I got one 
part right: scripts are for<em> improving</em> user interaction; and user 
interaction shouldn't be dependent on it.&nbsp; But I wasn't "improving" 
enough. My markup should have pretended scripts didn't exist, that only the 
server existed to take in the input, and the script should have improved from 
there. (<em>Side Note:</em> this is why I can't 
wait for CSS3 Animations to finish up. Scripting shouldn't have to do it). 
Granted, right now lots of devices have scripting enabled. But to repeat: just 
because you can doesn't mean you should. Just because scripting is enabled 
doesn't mean you have to do an animation with it. That's not the script's job. 
It<em> is</em> the script's job to, for example, take a form (<em>that already 
works without scripts</em>) and improve it to use nice AJAX instead).</p>
<p>On the other hand, some web <em>applications</em> can set a strict user-base 
(or know a strict user base) and Javascript is the essential core of the 
application. I'm not talking about these. I'm talking about <em>public</em> 
websites, not intranet websites or internet/intranet applications. </p>
<p>Whether you actually support browsers that don't have scripting enabled or 
can't handle HTML5 and CSS3 is up to you. The point is to keep a 
separation of concern on these things. Even if you're not supporting 
script-disabled browsers, your display of content shouldn't depend on the user's 
interaction with it. Why? Separation of concerns:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If a new scripting technique comes on the scene and Javascript 
	becomes deprecated, your HTML/CSS should still work, etc.</li>
	<li>Scalability: You should be able to radically change the layout or design 
	of a page without scripts being affected; and vice-versa.</li>
	<li>Maintainability: Someone with zero knowledge of Javascript should be 
	able to edit the HTML/CSS files without fear (well, to a point. They 
	shouldn't scrapping ids or class names)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I realize there's some major overlap here. HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
aren't automagically and completely independant of each other. Sometimes you <em>
do</em> have to add an element solely for styling purposes. The world isn't 
perfect. On a better note, a <em>good </em>overlap occus with the <em>natural</em> 
overlap of HTML/CSS (class names, ids, tag names, the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag, etc). 
Additionally, anotherdesigned 'good' overlap is the DOM in Javascript. Some say 
it's crap. Some say it rocks. Whatever. The point is, if you're working with 
Javascript in the browser, in a website, you're primarily going to be 
modifiying, adding, and removing elements from the document. But when you start 
using Javascript to generate HTML that is <em>vital</em> to the execution of the 
page correctly, there's a problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There you go. The insane ramblings of one of millions of web developers. 
Please comment with your thoughts - I'm sure I've left something (obvious 
probably) out. Thanks!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<em>Thomas</em></p>
